description: My Electrostaff uses plasma tubes, powered by two high voltage transformers, which are activated by a lightsaber sound board for sounds and motion control. Like all my projects, it was designed in Autodesk Fusion and mounts inside and on the ends of a polycarbonate tube. The Magnaguard is consists mostly of EVA foam armor and a 3D printed helmet, with lights in both.
